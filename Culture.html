<h2 class="TextW">Population Of Italy</h2>
<h3>According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics
  Italy is home to approximately 59.6 million
   individuals as of 1 January 2020. About 96 percent of the population of Italy.
   though there are many other ethnicities
     that live in this country. North African Arab, Italo-Albanian,
      Albanian, German, Austrian and some other European groups
       fill out the remainder of the population. Bordering countries
        of France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north
     have influenced Italian culture, as have the Mediterranean islands of
      Sardinia and Sicily and Sardinia.</h3>
<h3>Of the 59.6 million people living in Italy as of 1 January 2020, 48.7 percent
   are men, 51.3 percent are women. 13 percent are children aged up to 15, 63.8 percent
    are believed to be aged 15 – 64 and 23.2 percent are 65 or older. 14,804 are 100
     years old or older. The largest percentage of the population, 26.8, lives in the
      North West of Italy. The largest city by population is Rome with over 2.8 million
       residents, while the smallest municipality is Morterone with a population of just 30
        people.</h3>
        <h2 class="TextW">Language of italy</h2>
        <h3>The official language of the country is Italian. About 93 percent of the Italian population speaks
           Italian as native language, according to the BBC. There are a number of dialects of the language spoken
            in the country, including Sardinian, Friulian, Neapolitan, Sicilian, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian and
             Calabrian. Milanese is also spoken in Milan. Other languages spoken by native Italians include Albanian,
              Bavarian, Catalan, Cimbrian, Corsican, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Slovenian and Walser.</h3>
              <h2 class="TextW">Religion in Italy</h2>
              <h3>The major religion in Italy is Roman Catholicism. This is not surprising, as Vatican City, located in the heart
                 of Rome, is the hub of Roman Catholicism and where the Pope resides. Roman Catholics and other Christians make up 80
                  percent of the population, though only one-third of those are practicing Catholics. The country also has a growing
                   Muslim immigrant community, according to the University of Michigan. Muslim, agnostic and atheist
                    make up the other 20 percent of the population, according to the Central Intelligence Agency.</h3>
                    <h3>The number of Italians who attend religious services at least once a week has declined substantially from 2006 to
                       2020, according to Statista. A little over 18 million Italians aged six and older attended weekly
                        services in 2006, down to 12 million by 2020. </h3>
                        <h2 class="TextW">art and architeculture in italy</h2>
                        <h3>Italy has given rise to a number of architectural styles, including classical Roman, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical.
                           Italy is home to some of the most famous structures in the world, including the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The
                            concept of a basilica — which was originally used to describe an open public court building and evolved to mean a Catholic pilgrimage
                             site — was born in Italy. The word, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is derived from Latin and meant "royal palace.
                             " The word is also from the Greek basilikē, which is the feminine of basilikos which means "royal" or basileus, which means "king."</h3>
                             <h3>Italy is also  home to many castles, such as the Valle d'Aosta Fort Bard, the Verrès Castle and the Ussel Castle.</h3>
                             <h3>Florence, Venice and Rome are home to many museums, but art can be viewed in churches and public buildings. Most notable is the ceiling
                                of the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, painted by Michelangelo sometime between 1508 and 1512.</h3>
